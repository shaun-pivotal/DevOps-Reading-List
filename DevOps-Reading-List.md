# DevOps Reading List

Continuous learning is key to the success of any technology professional. When I began researching the (then) fairly new topic of DevOps back around 2011, I started collecting a list of reading materials. I’ve expanded this list over the years, and want to share it more broadly in hopes that it accelerates the DevOps learning journey for anyone looking to dive more deeply into this subject. 

I’ve divided the list into 3 sections:
1. Foundational reading that helps cover DevOps as a topic
2. Books more technical in nature
3. Books more cultural in nature

By releasing this list on GitHub am hoping that it can benefit from a community getting behind it and submitting improvement ideas.

Amazon links are provided for convenience only.
